# Symbiosis AI

A vendor-neutral, human-in-the-loop continuous risk **verification** platform for property
insurers and insured businesses. See [PROJECT_SPEC.md](PROJECT_SPEC.md) for the locked
architecture (single source of truth).

## Status

Phase **S0 — Repository foundation** only. There is no product behavior and **no local runtime
yet**: `pnpm dev` intentionally fails with a "not implemented" message. Progress is tracked in
[docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATE.md).

## Layout

`apps/` (web, api, worker, simulator) · `packages/` (logical modules) · `adapters/` ·
`config/` (versioned policies) · `firmware/` · `firmware-contracts/` · `infrastructure/` ·
`tests/` · `docs/`. See spec §44.

## Commands

Requires Node >= 20 and pnpm.

```
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

## Secrets

Never commit secrets. `.env.example` lists placeholder names only; production secrets will use
Google Secret Manager.
